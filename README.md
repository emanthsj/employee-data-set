Employee Performance Analysis Using Power BI 
In this project, I used SQL to store and manage employee data, and Power BI to visualize insights from 2021 to 2023. I implemented slicers for designation and year to filter data interactively. Created visualizations like clustered bar charts to compare basic vs total salary by employee, and stacked bar charts to show education levels across departments. A pie chart highlighted the proportion of contract vs FTE staff. Year-wise performance ratings helped track employee progress, while map visuals and department-wise charts displayed employee distribution and strengths. This project supported strategic HR decisions by identifying top performers and salary trends.
